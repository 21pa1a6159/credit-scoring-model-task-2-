Credit Score Prediction: The second task focused on predicting credit scores using machine learning techniques. The code for this task is organized in the credit_score_prediction directory.
This project aims to explore and implement machine learning algorithms for credit score classification. By leveraging historical credit data, the objective is to train models that can accurately predict credit scores based on various financial and non-financial features.
The project will delve into feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation to create a robust and reliable credit scoring system. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the enhancement of credit risk assessment methodologies, providing financial institutions with more precise tools for evaluating potential borrowers. Through this exploration of machine learning in credit scoring, we aim to contribute to the ongoing evolution of the financial industry and promote more efficient and equitable lending practices
